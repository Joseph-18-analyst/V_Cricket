<p>
  Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of 11 players each on a field at the centre of which is a rectangular 22-yard long pitch. Each team takes its turn to bat, attempting to score runs, while the other team fields. Each turn is known as an innings.
The bowler delivers the ball to the batsman who attempts to hit the ball with his bat away from the fielders so he can run to the other end of the pitch and score a run. Each batsman continues batting until he is out. The batting team continues batting until ten batsmen are out, or a specified number of overs of six balls have been bowled, at which point the teams switch roles and the fielding team comes in to bat.Cricket was first played in southern England in the 16th century. By the end of the 18th century, it had developed to be the national sport of England. The expansion of the British Empire led to cricket being played overseas and by the mid-19th century the first international match was held. ICC, the game's governing body, has 10 full members.[2] The game is most popular in Australasia, England, the Indian subcontinent, the West Indies and Southern; Africa. </p>

  <h2>Emerging international cricketers </h2>
1.David Warner<br/>
<p>
A diminutive and dangerous opening batsman, David Warner exploded onto the international scene in 2008-09. His breathtaking effort of 89 from 43 balls in his Twenty20 debut against South Africa at the MCG was all the more remarkable as he was the first man to walk out for Australia before playing first-class cricket since 1877. His call-up had been a surprise and it capped off an eventful couple of months in which he also earned an IPL contract with Delhi Daredevils and a deal to use a two-sided bat. The rewards had come after he began the summer in dynamic fashion with a then New South Wales one-day record of 165, and followed it with 97 from 54 balls in the FR Cup, proving his success was not a one-off. His 390 runs in that competition came at a strike-rate of 129 and an average of 55.71.

Because of his limited-overs success, Warner was never considered for Tests - until 2011, when he was first called up as an injury replacement. In his second Test, Warner did what Langer and Hayden never achieved in their careers - he carried his bat, though it was in a historic loss to New Zealand.

2.Kane Williamson<br/>
<p>Kane Williamson, a right-hand top-order batsman, made his first-class debut in 2006-07 and played his first Under-19 game against the visiting Indians soon after. Born into a cricketing family - his father also represented Northern Districts at U-17 level - he was voted Player of the Tournament at the Gillette Cup schools' competition in 2007 and scored 47 off 65 balls against a senior Bangladeshi side in a rain-affected game at the end of the year. He is a part-time offspinner as well, and led New Zealand in the U-19 World Cup in Malaysia in 2008. His form in the 2009-10 domestic season was outstanding, prompting the selectors to pick him in the squad for the second Test against Australia in Hamilton. He was the highest run-scorer in the NZC one-day competition that season with 621 runs at 77.62 and he was rewarded with a call-up to the New Zealand one-day squad for the tri-series in Sri Lanka.

Williamson was always rated highly in New Zealand and immediately justified those expectations, scoring 131 in his maiden Test innings, against India in Ahmedabad in November 2010, to become only the eighth New Zealander to score a century on his Test debut. After that, he struggled in 2011, when performance didn't match potential, but he struck back in 2012, scoring a match-saving unbeaten 102 in the fourth innings against a South African attack that included Dale Steyn, Morne Morkel and Vernon Philander. By that time, he had already scored two ODI centuries and impressed several experts with his organised defensive technique and his elegant and classy strokeplay.

3.Virat Kohli<br/>
<p>A typical modern-day cricketer, Virat Kohli plays his game aggressively, bares his emotions loudly in public, yet retains the element of maturity that forms an integral part of every good and great player. Anil Kumble said he had thought hard before calling Kohli the best under-22 player in international cricket - that would rate as perhaps the best compliments he has received. It is also proof of Kohli's transformation as a player.

Kohli himself readily admitted to committing mistakes and walking the wrong path in the immediate aftermath of becoming only the second India captain to win the Under-19 World Cup in 2008. Monikers such as brash, arrogant were stuck on him as Kohli struggled to balance his career and the adulation that came with success. But some introspection and the expert guidance from the Indian team's seniors allowed Kohli to bounce back.

Today he is recognised for his growing maturity, and, more importantly, for his superb skills with bat in hand. Even in the presence, or absence, of his other prolific partners, Kohli has become one of the most dependable batsmen in the Indian middle order. His defensive technique is organised, he is an accomplished strokeplayer all round the wicket - his timing on the legside is especially silken - and he relishes performing when the pressure is on. He was an important presence during India's World Cup triumph, where he struck a vital century in the tournament opener and then played his hand in the summit clash with a patient 35 which formed a crucial part of the third-wicket partnership with Gautam Gambhir that allowed India to recover from the early loss of the openers.

4.Steve Smith
<p>Steven Smith started his career as a promising legspinner and talented batsman, but over the last couple of years, the legspin has taken a definite back seat while his batting has blossomed. That was in ample evidence when he played against India in Mohali in 2013. It was his first Test match in more than two years, and he responded superbly to pressure, scoring 92 and handling the spinners competently to confirm his early potential.
Smith was earmarked as a special talent quite early in his career: by the age of 21 he was in Australia's Test, one-day and Twenty20 teams, picked on promise and quickly showing the composure of a seasoned professional. There were words of caution about his early elevation, but there was no hiding the excitement about a player who gives the ball air, hits it hard, catches it at will and seems unbothered by pressure.

5.Ajinkya Rahane  
<p>Ajinkya Rahane is a top-order Mumbai batsman who, with 1089 runs in his second Ranji season, was a crucial factor in Mumbai's 38th title win. Only 11 players have scored 1000 runs in a single Ranji season, and that puts his effort in perspective. Rahane's progression to the Mumbai Ranji team was a natural one - he had represented them at all age levels, and was always seen as a prospective Mumbai player if not more. His bumper Ranji season followed an impressive showing in the 2007-08 Duleep Trophy, where he scored 172 against an England Lions attack that comprised Graham Onions, Monty Panesar, Steve Kirby and Liam Plunkett. That innings came after followers of Mumbai cricket had started to write him off as a a fine talent but fit only to make a swift 50. Two years later, he had shown they were way off.</p>

6.Joe Root
<p>
That Joe Root will one day captain England has been taken as read since he hit the grand old age of 23 - but for the moment it is his batting potential which so excites England. It is a rare England batsman who achieves maturity so quickly, but Root has looked consumed by the delights of batting from the moment he first took guard. Fast bowlers worldwide might begin to find his scampish grin a little wearing.
Root's Test debut for England in Nagpur in 2012 exemplified the qualities which had attracted coaches from an early age. He began with England's sixth-longest debut innings in terms of balls faced, 73 from 229 balls as he displayed the patience and discrimination demanded both by the situation of the game and a desperately slow surface.
Root had never been a strikingly heavy scorer as he worked through the ranks, nor was he particularly athletic, but his systematic approach to batting was that of a young batsman who would not sell his wicket easily and gave England hope that he would be able to attune his game to the highest level.

7.Moeen Ali  
<p>
Moeen Ali was tipped for the top long before he won his Test debut at the start of 2014. But, after building a reputation as an elegant batsman, it was his off-spin bowling that earned him the call-up when England were left reeling from the surprise retirement of Graeme Swann. While many critics dismissed him as a "part-time" bowler, Moeen had a record to compare with the best in county cricket over recent seasons. He had also developed a doosra after working with his friend and sometimes Worcestershire teammate, Saeed Ajmal. But it was his batting that stood out during his early Test appearances. He made an outstanding, unbeaten century in his second Test, at Leeds, as England went within two balls of saving the series and while he did unveil the first doosra bowled by an England spinner in the same game, he struggled to offer his captain the requisite control in the field with his bowling in his first three Tests. That changed in training for the Lord's Test against India. Encouraged by teammate Ian Bell over the need to bowl quicker to survive in international cricket, Moeen benefited from a chance conversation from former Test off-spinner Kumar Dharmasena, an umpire in the series and an on-looker at an England training session, who provided technical advice as to how to achieve the extra pace without losing any flight. It was to prove a pivotal meeting.
